## Installation

#### Setup

0. In order to run our app locally, you will need to have already installed Yarn and Rails. Check them with:


```bash
$ yarn -v
$ rails --version
```

If no version number is returned, please install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and/or [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html) before continuing.

#### Dependencies

1. You'll also need to install all dependencies of the project with:

```bash
$ bundle install && yarn install
```

The `bundle` command installs all Ruby Gems specified in our Gemfile. The `yarn install` command retrieves all dependencies from the projectâ€™s package.json file.
<br>
<br>

2. Run the following command to create a database, load the schema, and initialize it with our seed data.

```bash
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

#### API Keys

3. Lastly, our API keys are hidden. You will need to `touch` a `.env` file and populate it with your own [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/) and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference) API keys.

#### Launch ðŸš€

Finally! Lets launch the app by running:

```bash
$ rails s
```

```bash
$ yarn build --watch
```

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
